# PocketRPG


What does this plugin do?

This plugin makes your server an adventure.
PocketRPG creates classes, which people can play with in the world you have defined in the config.yml. In this world every class will have specialized weapons/abilities. Additionally, PocketRPG also adds quests, which you need a certain amount of exp. for to start. Quests will be fully configurable, quest name/quest item to finish/amount of items to finish/rewards/amount of rewards. More features will be added to this plugin.

  Classes added:
- Mage
- Warrior
- Tanker
- Assassin

Coming up:
- Making essential items for classes 'unlosable'.
- More classes people can play with.
- Bug fixes of course.
- (maybe) different languages.
